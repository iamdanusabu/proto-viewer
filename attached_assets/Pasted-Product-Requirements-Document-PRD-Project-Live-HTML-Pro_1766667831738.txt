Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: Live HTML Prototype Viewer with Device Mockups
1. Objective
Build a web-based application that allows users to paste HTML/CSS/JS code and preview it live inside realistic device mockups, starting with iPhone Pro Max devices, while preserving full interactivity (scrolling, clicking, forms, JS behavior).
The preview must accurately simulate device viewport size, safe areas, scroll behavior, and responsive layouts, similar to Figma’s prototype preview, but for live executable code.

2. Core Use Case


User pastes HTML-based code into the system.


User selects a target device (initially: iPhone Pro Max).


The system renders the code inside a full-size device mockup.


The rendered content behaves exactly as it would in a real browser:


Scrollable


Clickable


Supports JS interactions


Supports responsive CSS




User can visually inspect how the code behaves on that device.



3. Supported Input (Phase 1)


HTML


CSS (inline, <style>, or linked inside the pasted HTML)


JavaScript (inline or <script> tags)


No backend execution required in Phase 1



4. Device Support (Phase 1)
Initial Device


iPhone 15 Pro Max


Viewport size must match real device dimensions


Correct device aspect ratio


Safe area insets (top notch / bottom home indicator)


Scroll constrained to device screen only




Future Devices (Not required now, but architecture must allow):


Other iPhone models


Android phones


Tablets


Desktop browsers



5. Device Mockup Requirements


Use a realistic, high-fidelity device frame (SVG or image-based)


Screen area must be:


Precisely masked


Pixel-accurate to the device viewport




The HTML content must render inside the screen only


Outer device frame must be non-interactive


Only the screen area allows interaction



6. Rendering & Sandbox Behavior


The pasted code must be rendered in a sandboxed environment


Options:


<iframe> with sandbox attributes


Isolated execution context




Requirements:


No access to parent DOM


No cross-frame leakage


JavaScript execution allowed inside sandbox


CSS media queries must respond to the device viewport size





7. Responsiveness Simulation


The viewport size must be locked to the selected device dimensions


CSS media queries must behave exactly as on a real device


Zooming must be disabled by default


Orientation: Portrait only (Phase 1)



8. Interaction Requirements
Inside the device screen:


Scroll (vertical)


Click


Tap-like behavior


Form inputs


JS-driven UI interactions


Hover states optional (not required for mobile)


Outside the device:


No interaction allowed



9. User Interface (Editor Side)
Code Input


A multiline code editor area


Accepts full HTML documents


No syntax validation required initially


Device Selector


Dropdown or selector for:


iPhone 15 Pro Max (only option in Phase 1)




Preview Action


Auto-render on code change or


Manual “Preview” button (either is acceptable)



10. Layout Requirements


Split layout:


Left: Code editor


Right: Device mockup preview




Preview must remain visible while scrolling code


Preview must scale responsively on desktop without breaking aspect ratio



11. Performance Requirements


Preview render time < 500ms for typical HTML prototypes


No page reload when switching device


Re-render only the sandboxed preview on code change



12. Security Constraints


No access to:


Parent window


Cookies


LocalStorage outside sandbox




No network restrictions in Phase 1 (external CSS/JS allowed)


Prevent infinite loops from freezing the main UI (timeout or isolation recommended)



13. Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)


No backend APIs


No authentication


No collaboration


No version history


No export (PNG / video / share link)


No mobile touch gesture simulation beyond basic scroll/click



14. Acceptance Criteria
The system is considered complete when:


A user can paste HTML/CSS/JS.


Selecting iPhone 15 Pro Max renders the content inside a realistic device mockup.


The content scrolls only inside the device screen.


CSS media queries respond correctly to device width.


JavaScript interactions work normally.


The preview feels comparable to Figma’s prototype preview—but for live code.



15. Technical Flexibility


Implementation language/framework is open


Must be browser-based


Must be extensible to add more devices later without refactoring core architecture



That’s it.
No fluff. No opinions. No roadmap theater.
If you want:


A second version rewritten as a single AI prompt


A technical architecture breakdown


A build order checklist (Day 1 → MVP)


Say the word.
